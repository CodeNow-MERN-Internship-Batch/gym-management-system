# 🏋️ Prime Fitness Gym
### A MERN Stack Based Gym Management System

Prime Fitness Gym is a full-stack web application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It provides a complete gym management solution with two dedicated role-based dashboards — one for Administrators and one for Members.

Members get a personalized fitness experience powered by a BMI calculator that recommends fitness goals and delivers customized weekly workout plans and daily diet plans. Administrators get full control over member records and membership management.
